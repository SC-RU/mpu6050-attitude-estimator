# MPU6050 Attitude Estimator

## Overview

This project implements register-level MPU6050 bring-up, calibration, sensor data acquisition, and roll/pitch attitude estimation.

The repository currently covers two versions of the same project:

- An Arduino Nano Every version used for initial bring-up, calibration, validation, and attitude-estimation development
- An STM32 version used to port the same pipeline to a more industry-standard embedded platform, now running on a FreeRTOS task-based architecture with improved timing control and a cleaner path toward higher-rate sampling

Rather than relying on third-party MPU6050 libraries, all sensor communication, configuration, calibration, and attitude estimation are implemented from scratch using direct I2C register access and the MPU6050 datasheet.

Current capabilities include:

- Register-level MPU6050 configuration
- Accelerometer calibration
- Gyroscope calibration
- Raw sensor data acquisition
- Physical unit conversion
- Roll and pitch estimation
- Gyroscope attitude integration
- Complementary filtering
- Fixed-rate sampling and timing control
- FreeRTOS task-based architecture (STM32)
- Modular software organization

## Features

### Accelerometer

The accelerometer is configured for a ±2 g measurement range.

During startup, the system:

1. Collects 500 stationary samples.
2. Computes average offsets for each axis.
3. Accounts for gravity on the Z-axis.
4. Stores calibration biases.
5. Converts readings into g and m/s².

***

### Gyroscope

The gyroscope is configured for a ±250 °/s measurement range.

During startup, the system:

1. Collects 500 stationary samples.
2. Computes average bias values.
3. Stores the offsets.
4. Converts readings into degrees per second.

Values close to zero while stationary indicate successful calibration.

## Attitude Estimation

Roll and pitch are estimated from accelerometer measurements using trigonometric relationships.

A gyroscope attitude estimate is maintained by integrating angular velocity over time.

A complementary filter combines both estimates:

```text
Filtered Angle = α × Gyroscope Estimate + (1 - α) × Accelerometer Estimate
```

This provides:

- Short-term stability from the gyroscope
- Long-term drift correction from the accelerometer

## Telemetry Output

The current firmware outputs one compact CSV telemetry line per sample over the serial/UART interface. This format is intended for logging, plotting, and host-side parsing.

### CSV Format

```text
time_MS,accel.roll,accel.pitch,gyro.roll,gyro.pitch,filtered.roll,filtered.pitch
```

Each field represents:

1. `time_MS` — loop timestamp in milliseconds
2. `accel.roll` — roll estimate from the accelerometer
3. `accel.pitch` — pitch estimate from the accelerometer
4. `gyro.roll` — roll estimate from gyroscope integration only
5. `gyro.pitch` — pitch estimate from gyroscope integration only
6. `filtered.roll` — complementary-filtered roll estimate
7. `filtered.pitch` — complementary-filtered pitch estimate

### Example Output

```text
1250,0.842,-1.316,0.905,-1.271,0.904,-1.272
1260,0.851,-1.308,0.914,-1.262,0.913,-1.263
1270,0.847,-1.311,0.923,-1.254,0.921,-1.255
```

## Building and Running

### Arduino Version

1. Open the `Arduino/` project in PlatformIO.
2. Build and upload the firmware to the Arduino Nano Every.
3. Open the serial monitor to view the telemetry stream.

### STM32 Version

1. Open the `STM32_Nucleo_F446RE/` project in your STM32 development environment.
2. Build and flash the firmware to the STM32 board.
3. Open the configured serial/UART output to view the telemetry stream.

The STM32 firmware runs on FreeRTOS, with sensor acquisition, attitude estimation, and telemetry output implemented as separate tasks.
