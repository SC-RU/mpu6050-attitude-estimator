# Attitude Estimation

## Overview

This module estimates the orientation of the MPU6050 using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.

The current implementation estimates two Euler angles:

- Roll
- Pitch

Yaw is not estimated in the current implementation. The MPU6050 provides a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope, but it does not include an onboard magnetometer, so yaw cannot be corrected against a fixed heading reference and would drift if estimated from gyroscope integration alone.

---

## Estimation Strategy

The attitude estimator combines two sources of information:

- **Accelerometer data**, which provides a gravity-based estimate of roll and pitch
- **Gyroscope data**, which provides short-term angular rate information

Each sensor has different strengths and weaknesses, so the final estimate is produced using a complementary filter.

On the STM32 version, this estimation logic runs inside a dedicated `AttitudeTask`, which consumes raw samples from a queue populated by a separate sensor-acquisition task.

## Accelerometer Estimate

When the IMU is stationary or moving slowly, gravity provides a reference vector that can be used to estimate orientation.

After calibration and conversion to physical units, roll and pitch are computed from the accelerometer measurements.

### Roll

```text
roll = atan2(-ax, sqrt(ay² + az²))
```

### Pitch

```text
pitch = atan2(ay, az)
```

The resulting angles are converted from radians to degrees.

### Strengths

- Does not accumulate drift
- Simple to compute
- Provides a long-term reference for roll and pitch

### Limitations

- Sensitive to vibration
- Sensitive to linear acceleration
- Noisy during rapid motion

## Gyroscope Estimate

The gyroscope measures angular velocity in degrees per second.

Orientation is estimated by integrating angular velocity over time:

```text
angle = previous_angle + angular_velocity × dt
```

where:

- `angular_velocity` is measured in degrees per second
- `dt` is the elapsed loop time in seconds

### Strengths

- Smooth output
- Good short-term motion tracking
- Responds well to rapid motion

### Limitations

- Small bias errors accumulate over time
- Long-term drift is unavoidable

## Loop Timing

Accurate loop timing is essential because gyroscope integration depends directly on the value of `dt`.

In the Arduino version, `dt` is computed from the elapsed time between iterations using a millisecond timer. Since that timer returns elapsed time in milliseconds, the difference between successive timestamps is divided by 1000.0 to convert the interval into seconds.

A generic form is:

```text
dt = (currentTime - lastLoopTime) / 1000.0
```

In the STM32 version, sensor acquisition runs inside `SensorTask` on a fixed 100 Hz period enforced by `vTaskDelayUntil()`. Because this period is constant by construction, `AttitudeTask` computes `dt` directly from the configured sensor period rather than measuring elapsed time on each iteration:

```text
dt = SENSOR_TASK_PERIOD_MS / 1000.0
```

Each raw sample carries the timestamp at which it was acquired, and this timestamp is propagated through calibration and estimation so that the resulting attitude snapshot corresponds to a specific sampling instant rather than the time at which telemetry happens to be sent.

If the timing interval is inconsistent or scaled incorrectly, the gyroscope estimate will accumulate error even when the angular-rate measurements are correct.

---

## Complementary Filter

The accelerometer provides long-term stability, while the gyroscope provides smooth short-term tracking.

A complementary filter combines both estimates:

```text
filtered = α × gyro_estimate + (1 - α) × accel_estimate
```

The current implementation uses:

```text
α = 0.98
```

This means:

- 98% of the estimate comes from the gyroscope
- 2% comes from the accelerometer

The filtered result is then used as the starting point for the next gyroscope integration step. This allows the gyroscope to dominate short-term motion while the accelerometer continuously corrects long-term drift.

On the STM32 version, this fused result is published under a mutex so that a separate telemetry task can safely read it without interfering with the estimation task.

---

## Current Scope

The current implementation estimates roll and pitch only.

The estimator is designed as a lightweight attitude solution for the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE platform and serves as a foundation for future improvements such as:

- Real-time visualization
- Higher-rate sampling and timing refinement
- Quaternion attitude representation
- Madgwick or Mahony sensor fusion
- Kalman filtering
- Full 3D orientation estimation
